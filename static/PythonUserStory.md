### **User Story: Validate Provider Segment in 837 Transaction**

**Story ID**: `LVL4-003`

**Title**: Implement Python Function to Validate NPI and Address in Provider Segment

---

**Description**:
As a **Developer**, I want to implement a Python function to validate the National Provider Identifier (NPI) and address information in the provider segment of an 837 transaction so that invalid data is identified and rejected before further processing.

The function will ensure that:
- The NPI is a valid 10-digit numeric value.
- The address contains the required fields (street, city, state, ZIP code) and is correctly formatted.

This will help maintain data integrity and ensure that only valid claims are processed.

---

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1. **NPI Validation**:
   - The function must check if the NPI (`NM109`) is exactly 10 digits long and is numeric.
   - If the NPI is invalid, the function should return an error message indicating the invalid NPI.

2. **Address Validation**:
   - The function must validate that the address (`N3` segment) is not empty.
   - The city, state, and ZIP code (`N4` segment) must be present and formatted as:
     - City: Alphabetic characters and spaces only.
     - State: A 2-character uppercase alphabetic code.
     - ZIP Code: A 5-digit or 9-digit numeric code (the 9-digit ZIP can be in the format `12345-6789`).

3. **Error Handling**:
   - If the function encounters any validation errors, it must return a list of error messages, each detailing the specific issue.
   - If no errors are found, the function should return a message indicating that the provider segment is valid.

4. **Test Cases**:
   - Unit tests should be written to cover various scenarios, including:
     - Valid NPI and address (no errors).
     - Invalid NPI (non-numeric, wrong length).
     - Missing address line.
     - Invalid city, state, or ZIP code formats.

5. **Documentation**:
   - The function should include docstrings explaining its purpose, inputs, and outputs.
   - A separate markdown file should be created to document how the function works, how to run it, and how to interpret its output.

**Tasks**:
1. Implement the Python function for NPI and address validation.
2. Write unit tests to cover all possible scenarios.
3. Document the function and its usage in a markdown file.
4. Perform code review and address any feedback.
5. Deploy the function and ensure it's integrated into the processing pipeline.

---

**Dependencies**:
- Knowledge of 837 transaction structures, specifically the provider segments.
- Access to sample 837 transaction files for testing.

---

**Attachments**:
- Example 837 transaction files (for testing).
- Link to the HIPAA 837 Implementation Guide.

**Notes**:
- This function is critical for ensuring that only valid provider information is processed. Incorrect data can lead to claim rejections or processing delays, impacting business operations.
